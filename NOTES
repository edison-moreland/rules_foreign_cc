get pkg-config from https://pkgconfig.freedesktop.org/releases/pkg-config-0.29.2.tar.gz
get glib-dev from https://download.gnome.org/binaries/win64/glib/2.26/

in pkg-config, mkdir release\x64\pkg-config and then run nmake /f Makefile.vc CFG=release GLIB_PREFIX="C:\msys64\home\jheaffey\git\rules_foreign_cc"

note that at run time it depends on various things, run "ldd" in mingw64 msys2, e.g. glib-runtime (https://download.gnome.org/binaries/win64/glib/2.26/), iconv etc

for linux, use ./configure --internal-glib or whatever it is

----
try to resolve - https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_foreign_cc/issues/391, i.e pkg-config needs to be run with dlls, as will qt binaries. Could make a wrapper script that sets PATH on win or LD_LBIRARY_PATH on linux. Ideally the binaries produced by rules_foreign_cc will be like cc_binaries

Seems like there is a CcLauncherInfo but can only be used in native java, which copies dlls to the binary dir

What can I do instead? I can write a sh_binary that sets the PATH variable when being run

make a macro that uses bin output group to make a sh_binary


------

can build pkgconfig with "bazel build toolchains:pkgconfig_tool"
