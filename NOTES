get mesa building on windows. the mesa logs show that cmake, pkgconfig and python3 are from the system rather than hermetic, fix this and check it is hermetic on linux

Add mesa and glib build test to Linux, windows and mac

# sanbox issue - Is the issue due to the fact that shared objects are treated differently, to static libs? shared libs go in the _so folder while static libs are added to sandbox where they were before

# TODO - after adding PKG_CONFIG and CMAKE env vars to meson build, the build changed and it seems that system packages werent found with pkg-config, but the hermetic pkg-config should have been on the path as it is in ext_build_deps, why isnt it?
